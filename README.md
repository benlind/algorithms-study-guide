## O, Θ, and Ω Notation

f(x) = O(g(x)) (big-oh) means that the growth rate of f(x) is asymptotically **less than *or equal to*** to the growth rate of g(x).

f(x) = Ω(g(x)) (big-omega) means that the growth rate of f(x) is asymptotically **greater than *or equal to*** the growth rate of g(x)

f(x) = o(g(x)) (small-oh) means that the growth rate of f(x) is asymptotically **less than** the growth rate of g(x).

f(x) = ω(g(x)) (small-omega) means that the growth rate of f(x) is asymptotically **greater than** the growth rate of g(x)

f(x) = Θ(g(x)) (theta) means that the growth rate of f(x) is asymptotically **equal to** the growth rate of g(x)
